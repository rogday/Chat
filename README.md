# Chat
Simple asynchronous chat client and server.

### Compilation:
It is preferable to use server under Linux since it wasn't tested under any other operating system.
Client on the other hand was successfully tested under both Linux and Windows.


You should have git, mariadb, mariadb-connector-c, boost and cmake installed in order to build the server. 
Simply clone the repository and run cmake/make.
Building of client requires Qt and boost only, Qt Creator project file is included.

### Usage:
```
